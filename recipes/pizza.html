    <h2>Pizza:</h2>
    <p>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin 
        consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped 
        with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, 
        mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a
         high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small 
        pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p><br>
